> Script to increase the line height of a font

# Intro
This script shouldn't really exist, and patching fonts in this way isn't really such
a good idea. However, Emacs currently doesn't have proper support for adjusting
line height, as summarized in [this stack overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26437034/emacs-line-height). The only
workaround that I have found to work reliably, is to patch the font itself to
include the proper spacing. So, here is a script that at least makes the process easy.

# Examples

The easiest way to run the script is to build a docker image via the
`Dockerfile` provided.

```bash
# build the image (only required once)
docker build -t font-patcher .
```

If you are using the examples below as is, make sure to copy your original font into the `fonts`
directory of this project so the files will be mapped into the container.

### Patch a single font file

```bash
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/home font-patcher \
    /usr/bin/python /home/src/main.py \
    --factor=1.3 \ # increase the line height by 30%
    --input=/home/fonts/Operator\ Mono.otf \ # mounted path to the original font file
    --outputDir=/home/fonts/patched # directory to save the new font file
```

### Patch multiple font files at once

This is really just the repetition of patching a single font file, but since
it's so common, here is an example:

```bash
for x in $(/bin/ls fonts/OperatorMono); do
    docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/home font-patcher \
        /usr/bin/python /home/src/main.py \
        --factor=1.3 \ # increase the line height by 30%
        --input=/home/fonts/OperatorMono/$x \ # mounted path to the original font file
        --outputDir=/home/fonts/patched # directory to save the new font file
done
```

Once your fonts are patched, you can install them on your machine for future use.
